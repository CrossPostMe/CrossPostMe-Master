# 📊 **SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM**

## **Selling Online is BROKEN** 💔

### **Meet Sarah - A Typical Marketplace Seller:**

- Sells furniture on Facebook Marketplace, eBay, OfferUp, Craigslist
- Spends **4+ hours/day** manually posting the same item 4 times
- Manually tracking inventory across platforms
- Missing 60% of potential buyers (wrong platform at wrong time)
- **Lost $15,000 last year** due to inefficiency

### **The Numbers:**

| Pain Point | Impact | Cost |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Manual Posting** | 4 hours/day wasted | $28,800/year |
| **Missed Sales** | 60% buyers never see listing | $15,000/year |
| **Inventory Chaos** | Sells same item twice | $2,400/year |
| **Late Responses** | 45% buyers move on | $8,700/year |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COST** | — | **$54,900** |

### **130M+ sellers face this problem EVERY DAY**
